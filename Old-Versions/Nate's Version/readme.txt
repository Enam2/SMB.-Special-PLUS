---- SMB Special Powerups Pack by IAmPlayer ----

This NPC Pack includes the exclusive powerups in Super Mario Bros. Special, made by Hudson Soft. Currently, this
pack includes the Wing powerup, Lucky Star, the Clock, Hachisuke/Hu-Bee, and Hammer. The wing allows the player to
"fly" around the level by swimming in the air for the duration of 10 seconds. The Lucky Star makes all enemies on
screen be defeated, even works for bosses, similar to Starman's ability in Super Mario Maker. It works like a
POW block, but it's able to kill airborne enemies. The clock is pretty self-explanatory, it adds 100 seconds on the
timer, but can be customized if it would be used more frequently. Hachisuke/Hu-Bee gives the player 8000 points,
and also increases the player's jump height for 10 seconds when 'newability' configuration is set to true in
Hu-Bee's npc.txt file. Hammer surrounds the player's side with a hammer that moves around in the two positions, and
lasts for 10 seconds. The hammer defeats enemies, and also able to break blocks.

NPC Configuration Lists:
- duration: Used by Wing, Hachisuke/Hu-Bee, and Hammer. It is used to determine how much does it to take for the
            ability to last.
- newability: Used by Hachisuke/Hu-Bee. It is used to allow the new ability not available in Super Mario Bros. Special
              to be used.
- timeboost: Used by Clock. It is used to add the amount of seconds in the timer.
- usesfx: Used by Hammer. It is used to simulate the Hammer sound effect from the original Donkey Kong.
